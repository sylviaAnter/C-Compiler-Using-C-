# C-Compiler-Using-C-
A custom compiler built using C++ to compile C language source code, developed 
📝 Overview

This project is a custom compiler implemented in C++ that is capable of compiling C language source code.
The compiler demonstrates core concepts of compiler design and programming language processing.

🧠 Compiler Phases Implemented

The compiler includes the following main phases:

🔤 Lexical Analysis

Tokenization of C source code

Identification of keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals

🧾 Syntax Analysis

Parsing the token stream

Grammar validation using parsing techniques

🌳 Semantic Analysis

Symbol table management

Type checking and scope validation

⚙️ Intermediate Code Generation

Generation of intermediate representation (IR)

Optimization-ready structure

🧮 Code Generation

Translation to target-level code (or executable form)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: C++

Target Language: C

Concepts: Compiler Design, Parsing, Tokenization, Symbol Table
